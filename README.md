# Anti iHunch

## What is iHunch

iHunch means Forward Head Posture (FHP). In Chinese, iHunch is "頸前傾".
Forward Head Posture is the cause of discomfort in the upper back and the neck. Normally, the center of our head should be directly above the neck, and the center of the top of the head should be in a straight line with the first cervical vertebra (C1) and the midline of the body. But for the people with FHP, the center of the head is obliquely in front of the neck, that is, in front of this straight line.

## Purpose of Anti iHunch

Confirm the relative position of the head through face detection, and detect whether the users are hunched. If the users are hunched, Anti iHunch will remind the users to keep their heads up.
